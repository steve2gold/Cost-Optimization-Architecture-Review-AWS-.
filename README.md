Architecture Summary

The environment consists of a small AWS workload used to demonstrate monitoring and cost analysis. AWS cost and monitoring tools are configured to track usage, identify inefficiencies, and enforce budget controls.

High-Level Flow

EC2 instance generates usage metrics

CloudWatch collects performance data

Cost Explorer analyzes service-level spending

Budgets enforce spending thresholds

Trusted Advisor provides optimization recommendations.

AWS Services Used:

- Amazon EC2

- AWS Cost Explorer

- AWS Budgets

- Amazon CloudWatch

- AWS Trusted Advisor

- AWS IAM

Objectives.

- Understand how AWS costs are generated and tracked

- Monitor EC2 utilization using CloudWatch

- Detect underutilized or idle resources

- Configure budget alerts to prevent overspending

- Apply AWS Well-Architected cost optimization principles

- Document actionable optimization recommendations.



Implementation Steps (Console-Based).

1. EC2 Environment Setup

. Launched an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux

. Selected a low-cost instance type (t2.micro or t3.micro)

. Enabled detailed monitoring

. Applied least-privilege security group rules

Purpose:

. Create a realistic workload for monitoring and cost evaluation.


2. Enable AWS Cost Explorer

. Opened Billing → Cost Explorer

. Activated Cost Explorer

Viewed:

. Daily cost trends

. Service-level cost breakdown

Usage by EC2

Purpose:

. Gain visibility into how AWS services contribute to total spend.


3. Configure AWS Budgets

. Created a monthly cost budget

. Defined a threshold (example: 80% and 100%)

. Configured email alerts

. Linked budget to account-level spending

Purpose:

. Prevent unexpected charges

. Demonstrate governance and financial controls


4. Monitor EC2 Metrics Using CloudWatch

. Accessed CloudWatch → Metrics → EC2

Reviewed:

. CPU Utilization

. Network In / Out

. Status Check metrics

. Created CloudWatch alarms for:

. Low CPU utilization (indicating underuse)

. Instance health issues

Purpose:

- Detect underutilized compute resources

- Support rightsizing decisions


5. Review Trusted Advisor Recommendations

. Accessed Trusted Advisor dashboard

. Reviewed checks related to:

. Cost optimization

. Security

. Fault tolerance

. Service limits

. Identified underutilized or idle resources

Purpose:

- Apply AWS best-practice recommendations automatically generated by AWS


Security Considerations:

- IAM permissions limited to required services only

- No public access granted unnecessarily

- Monitoring enabled for visibility

- Alerts configured to notify on abnormal behavior


Monitoring & Observability:

- CloudWatch metrics used for real-time performance visibility

- Alarms configured to trigger notifications

- Cost Explorer used for trend analysis

- Budget alerts used for proactive cost control


Cost Optimization Findings
Observations:

- EC2 CPU utilization remained consistently low

- No spending alerts were configured initially

- Monitoring was not enabled by default

- Potential unused or idle resources detected




Optimization Recommendations:

- Right-size EC2 instances based on actual usage

- Stop or terminate unused instances

- Enable AWS Budgets for all environments

- Consider Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for long-running workloads

- Enable lifecycle management for unused resources

- Periodically review Trusted Advisor recommendations





# Cost Analysis Findings

This document summarizes observations identified during a cost and usage review of the AWS environment. The review was conducted using AWS Cost Explorer, CloudWatch, and Trusted Advisor, following the AWS Well-Architected Framework (Cost Optimization Pillar).

---

## Summary of Findings

The analysis revealed opportunities to improve cost efficiency, monitoring coverage, and governance controls. While the environment operates correctly, several optimization gaps were identified that are common in early-stage or unmanaged AWS accounts.

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Low EC2 Utilization
- CloudWatch metrics show consistently low CPU utilization over extended periods.
- Average CPU usage remained well below recommended thresholds for optimal instance sizing.
- Indicates potential over-provisioning of compute resources.

**Impact:**
- Paying for unused compute capacity.
- Increased operational cost without performance benefit.

---

### 2. Lack of Cost Visibility Before Configuration
- Cost Explorer was not enabled by default.
- No historical cost analysis or trend tracking was initially available.
- Limited visibility into service-level spending prior to setup.

**Impact:**
- Difficult to identify cost drivers early.
- Harder to forecast or control monthly spend.

---

### 3. No Budget Alerts Initially Configured
- No active AWS Budgets were configured before review.
- Accoun






# Cost Optimization Recommendations

This document provides actionable recommendations based on the findings from the AWS cost and usage review. All recommendations align with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, particularly the Cost Optimization pillar.

---

## 1. Right-Size EC2 Instances

### Recommendation
Evaluate current EC2 instance types and resize them according to actual utilization metrics.

### Actions
- Review CloudWatch CPU utilization trends
- Identify consistently underutilized instances
- Resize to smaller instance types where appropriate

### Benefit
- Reduces unnecessary compute spending
- Improves cost-to-performance efficiency

---

## 2. Enable and Enforce AWS Budgets

### Recommendation
Maintain active cost budgets with alert thresholds.

### Actions
- Configure monthly budget limits
- Set alert notifications at 80% and 100%
- Review alerts regularly

### Benefit
- Prevents unexpected billing surprises
- Improves financial governance and accountability

---

## 3. Improve Monitoring and Alerting

### Recommendation
Expand CloudWatch alarm coverage to detect inefficiencies and failures early.

### Actions
- Create alarms for:
  - Low CPU utilization
  - Instance status check failures
  - Abnormal metric behavior
- Route alerts through Amazon SNS

### Benefit
- Enables proactive response
- Reduces operational risk
- Improves system reliability

---

## 4. Review Trusted Advisor Regularly

### Recommendation
Perform periodic reviews of Trusted Advisor checks.

### Actions
- Review cost optimization checks monthly
- Address flagged underutilized resources
- Monitor service limit warnings

### Benefit
- Continuous alignment with AWS best practices
- Easy identification of cost-saving opportunities

---

## 5. Consider Long-Term Cost Optimization Options

### Recommendation
For stable or long-running workloads, evaluate discounted pricing models.

### Options
- Compute Savings Plans
- EC2 Reserved Instances

### Benefit
- Significant long-term cost reduction
- Predictable monthly expenses

---

## 6. Establish Cost Governance Practices

### Recommendation
Introduce basic governance controls as part of daily operations.

### Actions
