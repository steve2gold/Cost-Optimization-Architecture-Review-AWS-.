Architecture Summary

The environment consists of a small AWS workload used to demonstrate monitoring and cost analysis. AWS cost and monitoring tools are configured to track usage, identify inefficiencies, and enforce budget controls.

High-Level Flow

EC2 instance generates usage metrics

CloudWatch collects performance data

Cost Explorer analyzes service-level spending

Budgets enforce spending thresholds

Trusted Advisor provides optimization recommendations.

AWS Services Used:

- Amazon EC2

- AWS Cost Explorer

- AWS Budgets

- Amazon CloudWatch

- AWS Trusted Advisor

- AWS IAM

Objectives.

- Understand how AWS costs are generated and tracked

- Monitor EC2 utilization using CloudWatch

- Detect underutilized or idle resources

- Configure budget alerts to prevent overspending

- Apply AWS Well-Architected cost optimization principles

- Document actionable optimization recommendations.



Implementation Steps (Console-Based).

1. EC2 Environment Setup

. Launched an EC2 instance using Amazon Linux

. Selected a low-cost instance type (t2.micro or t3.micro)

. Enabled detailed monitoring

. Applied least-privilege security group rules

Purpose:

. Create a realistic workload for monitoring and cost evaluation.


2. Enable AWS Cost Explorer

. Opened Billing → Cost Explorer

. Activated Cost Explorer

Viewed:

. Daily cost trends

. Service-level cost breakdown

Usage by EC2

Purpose:

. Gain visibility into how AWS services contribute to total spend.


3. Configure AWS Budgets

. Created a monthly cost budget

. Defined a threshold (example: 80% and 100%)

. Configured email alerts

. Linked budget to account-level spending

Purpose:

. Prevent unexpected charges

. Demonstrate governance and financial controls


4. Monitor EC2 Metrics Using CloudWatch

. Accessed CloudWatch → Metrics → EC2

Reviewed:

. CPU Utilization

. Network In / Out

. Status Check metrics

. Created CloudWatch alarms for:

. Low CPU utilization (indicating underuse)

. Instance health issues

Purpose:

- Detect underutilized compute resources

- Support rightsizing decisions


5. Review Trusted Advisor Recommendations

. Accessed Trusted Advisor dashboard

. Reviewed checks related to:

. Cost optimization

. Security

. Fault tolerance

. Service limits

. Identified underutilized or idle resources

Purpose:

- Apply AWS best-practice recommendations automatically generated by AWS


Security Considerations:

- IAM permissions limited to required services only

- No public access granted unnecessarily

- Monitoring enabled for visibility

- Alerts configured to notify on abnormal behavior


Monitoring & Observability:

- CloudWatch metrics used for real-time performance visibility

- Alarms configured to trigger notifications

- Cost Explorer used for trend analysis

- Budget alerts used for proactive cost control


Cost Optimization Findings
Observations:

- EC2 CPU utilization remained consistently low

- No spending alerts were configured initially

- Monitoring was not enabled by default

- Potential unused or idle resources detected




Optimization Recommendations:

- Right-size EC2 instances based on actual usage

- Stop or terminate unused instances

- Enable AWS Budgets for all environments

- Consider Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for long-running workloads

- Enable lifecycle management for unused resources

- Periodically review Trusted Advisor recommendations
